     Basic requirements:<br />
     - Home Assistant with an MQTT broker setup. <br />
     - Frigate integration with MQTT setup. <br />
     Link: https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration <br />
     - LLM Vision integration with provider setup. <br />
     Link: https://github.com/valentinfrlch/ha-llmvision <br />
     - Downloader integration. <br />
     Link: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/downloader/<br /><br />
     
     Information:<br />
     - Only suitable for one Frigate camera, use multiple instances of this automation for multiple cameras if required. <br />
     - LLM Vision requires a provider setup for the automation to function, remember and memory options are optional. <br /><br />
     Description: <br />
     Use LLM Vision to analyse frigate snapshots and clips and send notifications via the Home Assistant companion app. <br />
     Monitors MQTT frigate/reviews topic of types [new] and [end]. <br />
     The Downloader integration has been used for storing the frigate files locally before sending them to LLM. In my experience this has improved the reliability.
     Note that the downloader folder will need maintained separately (i.e. old files deleted or backed up). This can be achieved automatically via a shell command or similar <br />
     This automation runs in parallel mode. <br /><br />
     Tested on Android only. <br /><br />
     
     Variables which may be useful for frigate message and AI prompts
       - input_objects = Objects required<br />
       - input_camera_name = Camera required<br />
       - camera_name = Camera triggered<br />
       - objects = Onjects found<br />
       - zone_names = Zones required<br />
       - after_zones = Zones triggered<br />
